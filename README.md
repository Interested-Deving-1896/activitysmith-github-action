# ActivitySmith GitHub Action

The official ActivitySmith GitHub Action. Send [Push Notifications](#push-notifications) with optional rich media, and drive [Live Activities](#live-activities) with full lifecycle control or stream updates directly from your workflows.

## Live Activities

</p>

GitHub Actions is a natural fit for full lifecycle control. A workflow has a
clear start, middle, and end, and step outputs make it easy to pass
`live_activity_id` from one step to the next. For most GitHub workflows, this
is the best way to drive Live Activities.

Use stream actions when the same Live Activity should be updated across
scheduled runs, separate workflows, or other stateless automation where you do
not want to store `live_activity_id` yourself.

Live Activity UI types:

- `segmented_progress`: best for step-based workflows like deployments, backups, and ETL pipelines
- `progress`: best for continuous jobs like uploads, reindexes, and long-running migrations tracked as a percentage
- `metrics`: best for live operational stats like server CPU and memory, queue depth, or replica lag
- `stats`: best for a compact grid of business or operational values
- `alert`: best for an important state with a message and optional actions
- `timer`: best for countdowns or elapsed-time tracking

### Recommended for GitHub Actions: Full lifecycle control

For deployments, releases, migrations, and other bounded workflows, use the
explicit lifecycle actions:

1. Run `start_live_activity` when the job starts.
2. Save the returned `live_activity_id`.
3. Run `update_live_activity` as the workflow moves forward.
4. Run `end_live_activity` when the work is finished.

#### Deployment workflow example

Use `segmented_progress` when the work has clear stages and you want the Live
Activity to mirror the workflow step by step.

#### Start

```yaml
- name: Start deployment Live Activity
  id: start_activity
  uses: ActivitySmithHQ/activitysmith-github-action@v1
  with:
    action: start_live_activity
    api-key: ${{ secrets.ACTIVITYSMITH_API_KEY }}
    payload: |
      content_state:
        title: "Deploying payments-api"
        subtitle: "Build container image"
        type: "segmented_progress"
        number_of_steps: 3
        current_step: 1
```

#### Update

```yaml
- name: Update deployment Live Activity
  uses: ActivitySmithHQ/activitysmith-github-action@v1
  with:
    action: update_live_activity
    api-key: ${{ secrets.ACTIVITYSMITH_API_KEY }}
    live-activity-id: ${{ steps.start_activity.outputs.live_activity_id }}
    payload: |
      content_state:
        title: "Deploying payments-api"
        subtitle: "Run database migrations"
        type: "segmented_progress"
        number_of_steps: 3
        current_step: 2
```

#### End

```yaml
- name: End deployment Live Activity
  uses: ActivitySmithHQ/activitysmith-github-action@v1
  with:
    action: end_live_activity
    api-key: ${{ secrets.ACTIVITYSMITH_API_KEY }}
    live-activity-id: ${{ steps.start_activity.outputs.live_activity_id }}
    payload: |
      content_state:
        title: "payments-api deployed"
        subtitle: "Production healthy"
        type: "segmented_progress"
        number_of_steps: 3
        current_step: 3
        auto_dismiss_seconds: 10
```

### Other lifecycle patterns

#### Progress example

Use `progress` when the state is naturally continuous, such as a long-running
upload, reindex, or data migration.

```yaml
- name: Update reindex Live Activity
  uses: ActivitySmithHQ/activitysmith-github-action@v1
  with:
    action: update_live_activity
    api-key: ${{ secrets.ACTIVITYSMITH_API_KEY }}
    live-activity-id: ${{ steps.start_activity.outputs.live_activity_id }}
    payload: |
      content_state:
        title: "Reindexing product search"
        subtitle: "catalog-v2"
        type: "progress"
        percentage: 60
```

#### Metrics example

Use `metrics` when you want to keep a small set of live stats visible during a
bounded workflow, such as canary health during a deployment or pressure metrics
while a migration is running.

```yaml
- name: Update canary health Live Activity
  uses: ActivitySmithHQ/activitysmith-github-action@v1
  with:
    action: update_live_activity
    api-key: ${{ secrets.ACTIVITYSMITH_API_KEY }}
    live-activity-id: ${{ steps.start_activity.outputs.live_activity_id }}
    payload: |
      content_state:
        title: "Canary Health"
        subtitle: "payments-api"
        type: "metrics"
        metrics:
          - label: "CPU"
            value: 31
            unit: "%"
          - label: "MEM"
            value: 58
            unit: "%"
```

### Live Activity Action

Just like Actionable Push Notifications, Live Activities can have a button that
opens a URL in a browser or triggers a webhook. Webhooks are executed by the
ActivitySmith backend.

#### Open URL action

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://cdn.activitysmith.com/features/live-activity-with-action.png?v=20260319-1" alt="Deployment Live Activity with action" width="680" />
</p>

```yaml
- name: Start Live Activity with open URL action
  id: start_activity
  uses: ActivitySmithHQ/activitysmith-github-action@v1
  with:
    action: start_live_activity
    api-key: ${{ secrets.ACTIVITYSMITH_API_KEY }}
    payload: |
      content_state:
        title: "Deploying payments-api"
        subtitle: "Running database migrations"
        type: "segmented_progress"
        number_of_steps: 5
        current_step: 3
      action:
        title: "Open Workflow"
        type: "open_url"
        url: "https://github.com/acme/payments-api/actions/runs/1234567890"
```

#### Webhook action

```yaml
- name: Update Live Activity with webhook action
  uses: ActivitySmithHQ/activitysmith-github-action@v1
  with:
    action: update_live_activity
    api-key: ${{ secrets.ACTIVITYSMITH_API_KEY }}
    live-activity-id: ${{ steps.start_activity.outputs.live_activity_id }}
    payload: |
      content_state:
        title: "Reindexing product search"
        subtitle: "Shard 7 of 12"
        number_of_steps: 12
        current_step: 7
      action:
        title: "Pause Reindex"
        type: "webhook"
        url: "https://ops.example.com/hooks/search/reindex/pause"
        method: "POST"
        body:
          job_id: "reindex-2026-03-19"
          requested_by: "activitysmith-github-action"
```

### Use stream when the activity spans multiple runs

Stream actions are still useful in GitHub Actions when the same Live Activity
should be updated by scheduled workflows, separate workflow runs, or jobs that
should stay stateless. In that case, send the latest state with a stable
`stream-key` and ActivitySmith will start or update the Live Activity for you.

#### Scheduled metrics example

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://cdn.activitysmith.com/features/metrics-live-activity-start.png" alt="Metrics stream example" width="680" />
</p>

```yaml
- name: Stream server health
  id: stream_activity
  uses: ActivitySmithHQ/activitysmith-github-action@v1
  with:
    action: stream_live_activity
    api-key: ${{ secrets.ACTIVITYSMITH_API_KEY }}
    stream-key: prod-web-1
    payload: |
      content_state:
        title: "Server Health"
        subtitle: "prod-web-1"
        type: "metrics"
        metrics:
          - label: "CPU"
            value: 9
            unit: "%"
          - label: "MEM"
            value: 45
            unit: "%"
```

Use `end_live_activity_stream` when the tracked thing is finished and you want
the Live Activity dismissed. `payload` is optional there. If you later send
another `stream_live_activity` request with the same `stream-key`,
ActivitySmith starts a new Live Activity for that stream again.

Stream responses include an `operation` field, also exposed as
`steps.<id>.outputs.operation`:

- `started`: ActivitySmith started a new Live Activity for this `stream-key`
- `updated`: ActivitySmith updated the current Live Activity
- `rotated`: ActivitySmith ended the previous Live Activity and started a new one
- `noop`: the incoming state matched the current state, so no update was sent
- `paused`: the stream is paused, so no Live Activity was started or updated
- `ended`: returned by `end_live_activity_stream` after the stream is ended

## Push Notifications

Push Notifications support three common patterns:

- simple delivery alerts
- rich media previews
- actionable follow-up from the notification itself

### Simple Push Notifications

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://cdn.activitysmith.com/features/deployment-push-notification.png" alt="Deployment push notification" width="680" />
</p>

```yaml
- name: Send push notification
  uses: ActivitySmithHQ/activitysmith-github-action@v1
  with:
    action: send_push_notification
    api-key: ${{ secrets.ACTIVITYSMITH_API_KEY }}
    payload: |
      title: "API Deployment"
      message: "New release deployed to production!"
```

### Rich Push Notifications with Media

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://cdn.activitysmith.com/features/rich-push-notification-with-image.png" alt="Rich push notification with image" width="680" />
</p>

```yaml
- name: Send rich push notification
  uses: ActivitySmithHQ/activitysmith-github-action@v1
  with:
    action: send_push_notification
    api-key: ${{ secrets.ACTIVITYSMITH_API_KEY }}
    payload: |
      title: "Homepage ready"
      message: "Your agent finished the redesign."
      media: "https://cdn.example.com/output/homepage-v2.png"
      redirection: "https://github.com/acme/web/pull/482"
```

Send images, videos, or audio with your push notifications, press and hold to preview media directly from the notification, then tap through to open the linked content.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://cdn.activitysmith.com/features/rich-push-notification-with-audio.png" alt="Rich push notification with audio" width="680" />
</p>

What will work:

- direct image URL: `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc.
- direct audio file URL: `.mp3`, `.m4a`, etc.
- direct video file URL: `.mp4`, `.mov`, etc.
- URL that responds with a proper media `Content-Type`, even if the path has no extension

`media` can be combined with `redirection`, but not with `actions`.

### Actionable Push Notifications

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://cdn.activitysmith.com/features/actionable-push-notifications-3.png" alt="Actionable push notification" width="680" />
</p>

Add redirection when tapping the notification should open a specific URL, and use action buttons when someone should be able to act on the notification immediately. Webhook actions are executed by ActivitySmith backend.

```yaml
- name: Send actionable push notification
  uses: ActivitySmithHQ/activitysmith-github-action@v1
  with:
    action: send_push_notification
    api-key: ${{ secrets.ACTIVITYSMITH_API_KEY }}
    payload: |
      title: "Build Failed 🚨"
      message: "CI pipeline failed on main branch"
      redirection: "https://github.com/org/repo/actions/runs/123456789"
      actions:
        - title: "Open Failing Run"
          type: "open_url"
          url: "https://github.com/org/repo/actions/runs/123456789"
        - title: "Create Incident"
          type: "webhook"
          url: "https://hooks.example.com/incidents/create"
          method: "POST"
          body:
            service: "payments-api"
            severity: "high"
```

## Widget Metrics

Update a metric used by ActivitySmith widgets. `value` can be a number or a string, and `timestamp` is optional.

```yaml
- name: Update deployment count
  uses: ActivitySmithHQ/activitysmith-github-action@v1
  with:
    action: update_metric_value
    api-key: ${{ secrets.ACTIVITYSMITH_API_KEY }}
    metric-key: deployments-today
    payload: |
      value: 42
```

## App Icon Badge Count

Show a number on the ActivitySmith app icon. Send `0` to clear it, and optionally target channels.

```yaml
- name: Update app icon badge
  uses: ActivitySmithHQ/activitysmith-github-action@v1
  with:
    action: update_app_icon_badge_count
    api-key: ${{ secrets.ACTIVITYSMITH_API_KEY }}
    channels: ops
    payload: |
      badge: 3
```

## Inputs

- `action` (required): `send_push_notification`, `stream_live_activity`, `end_live_activity_stream`, `start_live_activity`, `update_live_activity`, `end_live_activity`, `update_metric_value`, or `update_app_icon_badge_count`
- `api-key` (required): ActivitySmith API key
- `payload` (required except for `end_live_activity_stream`): inline JSON or YAML payload. The current ActivitySmith API payload is passed through, including notification tags; `stats`, `metrics`, `segmented_progress`, `progress`, `alert`, and `timer` Live Activities; widget metric values; and app icon badge counts.
- `payload-file-path` (optional): path to a `.json`, `.yml`, or `.yaml` payload file
- `live-activity-id` (required for `update_live_activity` and `end_live_activity`): Live Activity ID
- `stream-key` (required for `stream_live_activity` and `end_live_activity_stream`): stable key used to identify the tracked stream
- `metric-key` (required for `update_metric_value`): widget metric key
- `channels` (optional): comma-separated channels for `send_push_notification`, `stream_live_activity`, `start_live_activity`, and `update_app_icon_badge_count`
- `errors` (optional, default `false`): ActivitySmith failures set `ok: false` without failing the workflow. Set this to `true` only when an ActivitySmith failure should fail the step.
- `payload-delimiter` (optional): advanced override for nested payload flattening

## Outputs

- `ok`: `true` when the request succeeds, otherwise `false`
- `response`: JSON stringified API response or error response
- `time`: Unix epoch time (seconds) when the step finished
- `live_activity_id`: returned when a Live Activity start or stream request returns an activity ID
- `operation`: returned by stream actions, such as `started`, `updated`, `rotated`, `noop`, `paused`, or `ended`

## Notes

- Use either `payload` or `payload-file-path`.
- Both inline payloads and payload files can be JSON or YAML.
- Live Activity payloads go under `content_state` and should use snake_case keys.
- `live-activity-id` is required for update and end actions.
- `stream-key` is required for stream start/update and stream end actions.
- Push notification payloads support optional `media`, `redirection`, and up to 4 `actions`.
- Live Activity payloads support one optional `action`.
- `media` can be combined with `redirection`, but not with `actions`.
- `channels` only applies to `send_push_notification`, `stream_live_activity`, and `start_live_activity`. If your payload already includes `target` or `channels`, the action leaves it unchanged.
